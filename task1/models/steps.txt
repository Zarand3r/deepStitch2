STEP 1:
=======
Rawdata is /central/groups/tensorlab/rbao/balint_data/caltech_format
Split videos into classes, using the time stamps provided
Populate a balint_data/classification_data/task1 repository with subfolders corresponding to classes
Retain the name of the class in the filename

STEP 2:
=======
In each class folder, compute optical flow for all videos, populate an optical_flow subfolder 
This is the last preprocessing step

Step 3:
=======
Datadir is /central/groups/tensorlab/rbao/balint_data/classification_data
Find flow files in optical_flow subfolders of each class folder


Do this to reformat the positive and negative directories
find . -mindepth 2 -type f -print -exec mv {} . \;
rm -rf */;
mkdir optical_flow
find . -name 'flownet*' -exec mv {} optical_flow/ \;


Step 4:
=======
Train model to classify videos
Checkpoint is saved to checkpoints folder
Tensorboard logs are saved to lightning_logs folder


Step 5:
=======
View the tensorboard UI locally after pushing to github and pulling on remote
Tensorboard --logdir log_dir
