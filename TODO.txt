Create a pipeline like optical_flow to preprocess the videos we want to predict
Write a script to use checkpoints for prediction, incorporate into pipeline, outputs a label for that given clip
Write a script that loops through a preprocessed video and runs the script on every sliding window
Write a script that uses these lablel outputs to annotate the original video

Implement video stabilization
