Implement Grad Cam

mabe alexnet can't pick up fine grain detils
look at fine grain action recognition literature
explore attention models (transformer models) - human knowledge

two stage process:
from videos predict pose and from pose predict skill assessment
multi-task learning:
use network to predict pose and also skills assessment

incorporate context with RNN on top




Use TCN, train on skills labels (or retrain from TCN trained on action segmentation)
Try TCN for both kinematics and skills assessment and segmentation

feature extractor for all 3 tasks
fc heads


skills assessment and kinematics at the same time
use segmentation weight to initialize skills assessment weight in seperate model
Have the capability to initialize several layers, and the capaibility to combine losses from multiple FC heads
